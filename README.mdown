# Enyim Memcached Standard Client

This is a .NET client library for [memcached](http://memcached.org) written in C#. There is also a client for [Membase](http://membase.com)'s persistent memcached server.

Features:

* Understands both the binary and text protocols
* Highly configurable and extendable (custom configuration, serialization)
* Supports consistent hashing
* CheckAndSet operations
* Persistent connections for more speed
* SASL Authentication

## Requirements

You'll need .NET Standard 2.0 or later to use the precompiled binaries. To build the client, you'll need Visual Studio 2017 or later.

## Support

None.  I don't have the time to support this long term, and I am hoping that Amazon will take on the task.

## Questions?

First, have a look at the [wiki](http://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki). If you still have questions, please feel free to submit an issue ticket, but I can't garauntee any replies.
